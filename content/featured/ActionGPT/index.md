A plug and play framework for incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) into text-based action generation models. By carefully crafting prompts for LLMs, we generate richer and fine-grained descriptions of the action. We show that utilizing these detailed descriptions instead of the original action phrases leads to better alignment of text and motion spaces.
