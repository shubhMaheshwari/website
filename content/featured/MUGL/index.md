MUGL is a deep neural model for large-scale, variable-length, diverse generation of single and multi-person pose-based action sequences with locomotion. To enable intra/inter-category diversity, we model the latent generative space as a Conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder. We use a hybrid pose sequence representation with 3D pose sequences sourced from videos and 3D Kinect-based sequences of NTU-RGBD-120. Although smaller and simpler compared to baselines, MUGL outperforms the baselines across multiple generative model metrics
