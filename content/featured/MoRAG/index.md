A multi-part fusion based retrieval-augmented generation strategy for text-based human motion generation.
By effectively prompting large language models (LLMs), we address spelling errors and rephrasing issues in motion retrieval.
Our approach utilizes a multi-part retrieval strategy to improve the generalizability of motion retrieval across the language space.
